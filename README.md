<b>Note: </b> if you have problem when install package like @tensorflow/tfjs-node and @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder, you must force that process or install latest version of visual studio and python (the best way update or installation is directly when you install node), but you have problem yet, so in the node_modules you must move file "tensorflow.dll" from "node_modules\@tensorflow\tfjs-node\lib\napi-v9" to "node_modules\@tensorflow\tfjs-node\lib\napi-v8".
